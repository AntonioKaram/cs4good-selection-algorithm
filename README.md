# Project Selection Algorithm
CS for Good Project Management Selection Site.
This is a Django Web Application

## Introduction
Assigning a large number of members to community service projects can be a daunting task. It requires considering multiple factors such as individual skills, project requirements, and member preferences. This project aims to create robust selection algorithms that automate this process, making it efficient, fair, and optimized.

## Features
- Efficient Assignment: The algorithms aim to efficiently assign members to community service projects, minimizing the time and effort required for manual allocation.
- Fairness and Equity: The algorithms consider member preferences and project requirements to ensure fairness and equitable distribution of assignments.
- Skill-Based Matching: The algorithms take into account the skills and expertise of members to match them with projects that align with their capabilities.
- Preference Customization: Members have the option to provide their preferences for specific types of projects, enabling personalized assignment based on their interests.
- Availability Constraints: The algorithms consider the availability of members and project timelines to avoid conflicts and ensure project completion.
- Scalability: The algorithms are designed to handle large datasets and can efficiently assign over 300 members to projects.
- Flexibility: The project provides a modular architecture, allowing easy customization and integration with existing system
